This is project in which the given signal is decoded and converted to text format
First the given sample has a noise and added preamble signal .
So the noise and preamble sample has taken away and the signal now is clean without any noise signal
Then the signal is compared with threshold value and the signal is serparted so that it can be converted in to binary bits
These binary bits are further divided into smaller equal groups so that they are converted to text format
This is java file coded in eclipse
